Project
My design is looking at family fun as a child i was always having fun on the mini golf course, as an adult it brought my family closer together while playing on these golf sites. So that was the insparation for creating my page.

HEADER
I created a header with an image for my page and input the text to go with it also deeciding on the color for the text.
I created links for a Home, Gallery, and a membership sign up pages.

brief text with what is on offer and added different images showing families having fun.

I had some problems getting the sizes in correct and inline for the three images but was able to overcome that issue with the help from w3 schools

I used some code from love running walkthrough to help with some aspects such as the links for the differnt pages.

I have run through the site and is performing as I was expecting 

BODY
I added a background color to keep inline with the header and added some text, while also creating some social media links which have been tested and work satisfactory which is based in the footer of the page.

MEMBERSHIP
I created a form to be filled out and used the code institute site for the form ("https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/") to see if it works after submitting all the information and also without entering the correct details, I also added a drop down menu for the form too asking for the users age.
